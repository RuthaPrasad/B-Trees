# B-Trees-Array-Implementation
To build and experiment with B-Trees as array implementations.

Language Restriction: C

Problem Definition:
Implement a B tree with the following operations:
1.	create
2.	insert
3.	delete
4.	search.
Experiment with different values of t - the minimum degree of each node.

Implement the B-tree as an array.
  Each node shall have # of records(key: rest of the record).
  The number of keys (but for the root node) shall be between t - 1 and 2t - 1.
  Each node at a given point in time may have k keys and k + 1 references to its child trees.
  In this implementation, each reference will be an index of the array.

Experiment varying the t and size of the node.

Data-Set and Resources: Dataset.
